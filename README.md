Work done during this project:
- Display three images at a time out of a folder that contains 14 images
- Created an object constructor that creates a new object for each image
- Created a random number generator so that the user sees a random image and also made it so that you will never see a duplicate image (if/else function)
- Created a counter that counts the users click (event listener was also utilized)
- After 15 clicks, a button will show up in the bottom lefthand corner and when that button is clicked, they can see their results
- Added a css animation so that when the user hovers over the image, it shakes
- Styled the page like a true amature software engineer
- Added Chart.js so that the user can visually see their results
